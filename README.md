- [ ] Disassemble binary files into assembly code
- [ ] Improve disassembly output formatting
- [ ] Add support for multiple architectures
- [ ] Implement unit tests
- [ ] Add a user-friendly CLI with options and help menu
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Add a user-friendly UI using **ratatui**
